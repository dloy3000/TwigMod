My first Terraria mod, the **Twig Mod** is a mod I made for fun and as a joke over a weekend. 

It adds several "Twigs" into the game, inspired by the fun idea of finding really nice sticks while on a walk through a park or forest. The Twigs are overpowered, but have a vanishingly tiny chance to drop from trees whenever you punch them. It's a simple mod and I probably won't add much more to it, but it was some fun code to mess around with.

The **Twig Mod** can be downloaded from the Steam Workshop for Tmodloader [here!](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3241918918)
